# 42 C Piscine Projects

This repository contains the subjects covered during the 42 C Piscine program (2023), designed to teach the fundamentals of C programming and shell usage.

## Shell

### Shell 00 - Basics
- Basic shell commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`)
- File and directory management
- Basic shell scripting (`echo`, `cat`, `touch`, `mkdir`)
- Understanding relative and absolute paths

### Shell 01 - Permissions and Advanced Commands
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Redirections (`>`, `>>`, `<`)
- Pipes (`|`)
- Linking (`ln`)
- Environment variables and `.bashrc`
